As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate 3D models or binary files such as .blend files used in Blender. These files are created using 3D modeling software and cannot be represented as text or code. I recommend using Blender or a similar 3D modeling software to create the "OperatingEnvironment.blend" file. The environment should be designed according to the specifications provided, featuring a futuristic operating room with interactive tools and UI elements.
